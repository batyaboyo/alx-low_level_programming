The README.md file which is for the **Directory of Functions nested loops** of _low level programming_ **Repository** will consist the to days' project task
The following are the **mandatory Tasks**

### files 
~~

# 0. _putchar
mandatory
Write a program that prints Holberton, followed by a new line.
•	The program should return 0

Repo:
•	GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
•	Directory: 0x02-functions_nested_loops
•	File: 0-holberton.c

# 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
mandatory
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
•	Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
•	You can only use _putchar twice in your code

Repo:
•	GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
•	Directory: 0x02-functions_nested_loops
•	File: 1-alphabet.c

# 2. 10 x alphabet
mandatory
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
•	Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
•	You can only use _putchar twice in your code

Repo:
•	GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
•	Directory: 0x02-functions_nested_loops
•	File: 2-print_alphabet_x10.c

# 3. islower
mandatory
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
•	Prototype: int _islower(int c);
•	Returns 1 if c is lowercase
•	Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islower to learn more.

Repo:
•	GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
•	Directory: 0x02-functions_nested_loops
•	File: 3-islower.c

# 4. isalpha
mandatory
Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
•	Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
•	Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
•	Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isalpha. Run man isalpha to learn more.

•	Directory: 0x02-functions_nested_loops
•	File: 4-isalpha.c

# 5. Sign
mandatory
Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
•	Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
•	Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
•	Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
•	Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

Repo:
•	GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
•	Directory: 0x02-functions_nested_loops
•	File: 5-sign.c
 
# 6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
mandatory
Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
•	Prototype: int _abs(int);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: abs. Run man abs to learn more.
 
Repo:
•	GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
•	Directory: 0x02-functions_nested_loops
•	File: 6-abs.c

# 7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
mandatory
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
•	Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
•	Returns the value of the last digit
 
Repo:
•	GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
•	Directory: 0x02-functions_nested_loops
•	*File: 7-print_last_digit.c*

# 8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
mandatory
Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
•	Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);
•	You can listen to this soundtrack while coding :)

•	GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
•	Directory: 0x02-functions_nested_loops
•	*File: 9-times_table.c*

# 10. a + b
mandatory
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
•	Prototype: int add(int, int);

# 11. Holberton School, 98 Battery Street, the OG
mandatory
## Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
•	Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
•	Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
•	Numbers should be printed in order
•	The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
•	The last printed number should be 98
•	You are allowed to use the standard library
