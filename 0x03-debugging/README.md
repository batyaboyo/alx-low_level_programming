Debugging
Rubber Duck Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.





Tasks
0. Multiple mains
mandatory
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:


Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x03-debugging
File: 0-main.c, main.h
  
1. Like, comment, subscribe
mandatory
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x03-debugging
File: 1-main.c
   
2. 0 > 972?
mandatory
This program prints the largest of three integers.
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x03-debugging
File: 2-largest_number.c, main.h
   
3. Leap year
mandatory
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x03-debugging
File: 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h
